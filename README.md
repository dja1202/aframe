Build a future cityscape: Imagine Atlanta in the year 2075. Create a view of the city -- either an aerial view or a street level view. This view could be a utopian, dystopian, or somewhere in between. Perhaps Atlanta has become a technological megalopolis, or perhaps the forest has reclaimed the ruins of the city. Use your imagination, and, as in version 1, try to use appropriate features of Aframe including animation and interactivity.
